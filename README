To use:
download the source, start a new virtualenv
pip install -e git+https://github.com/madisona/django-registration#egg=django-registration


I took James Bennett's django-registration as a starting point and have
copied it almost completely. I'd recommend you use his version.

The biggest difference is that I stripped out some stuff I don't find
immediately beneficial to me (like the internationalization and backends)
and I implemented the views using class based views new in Django 1.3.

Currently support Django 1.8+ on Python 2 and 3
